## Notes for self:

1. app folder contains all the files of each page
2. (index) in the app folder indicates that this is the index page/main route
3. src for all file is relative the app folder so if you want app/images/logo.png do /images/logo.png
4. "use client"; on top of each component that is interactive and DO NOT WANT to be client side
5. For the MongoDB prisma set up
   a. npm install -D prisma installs dependences
   b. npx prisma init
   c. npx prisma db push (pushes schema to online cluster)
   d. npm install next-auth@latest @prisma/client @next-auth/prisma-adapter bcrypt (dependences for next authentication)
   e. npm install -D @types/bcrypt
6. for routes and api paths in next.js create an api folder, the folders to represent the path
   a. api/auth/route.js|ts == /api/auth website path (request header) (ROUTE HANDLERS)
   b. api/auth/[route name]/route.ts == dynamic route/path where [] is the dynamic part
7. useRoutes hook because we want to dynamically change the active status dependent on if the user is openin a conversation or not
